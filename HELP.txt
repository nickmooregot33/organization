Purpose: To manage multiple projects, courses, chores, etc in a manner
	 that allows progress on all of the things without letting my
	 desire to do a million things get in the way.

	org [options]

	When no options are specified

Options:

	-h, --help

	Adds the track as specified in FILE to the tracklist and
	exits.  Track segments in FILE are organized in a
	chronological manner where the first segment to be completed

	The first line in FILE specifies the name of the track.

	specified track and exits.

	-l, --list-tracks
	Outputs the list of tracks and whether they are active and
	exits.

	Outputs the track and segment most recently assigned, when it
	was assigned, and whether it was completed or not, and exits.

	completed, and exits.

	-c, --completed-most-recent
