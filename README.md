Purpose
---
The purpose of this project is to organize my many different study and project tracks that I personally have going in an effort to promote progress in each different track and prevent any one track from taking over unintentionally.  The general idea is that I will just have all my projects and study lists entered into the organizer, and when I have time to work on something, I just let the organizer tell me what to do.  I'm sure that there are several applications out there that does this, and I know there are several Pomodoro timers, but this is as simple as I need, with room to grow for my own knowledge and skill development.

Thoughts

At the moment, the selection of an immediate project to work on is purely based on a pseudo random number generation feature of standard libraries to keep it simple.  In the future a system of priorities can be developed such that a higher priority project can be selected more often.  In that all of my project and study tracks seem to be of a high priority I don't have much use for prioritizing the selection right now.  Once I am to the point where I am including home maintainence into my track then it may be prudent to include that functionality.

Also in the future may be the inclusion of a pomodoro timer which will attempt to maximize productivity and develop good study habits in my children.  This could use GUI or ncurses programming to actually show the timer and what subject is being studied etc.  In the same track as a gui interface, this could be extended both to iOS and Android applications, once ported to the application development languages of those systems.  

Bookkeeping stuff

The initial idea for this project came about while I was studying at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the ECE department of the Engineering School.  I clearly didn't have the time to devote to this project at the time, but now the project will allow me to manage my studying for the FE exam, develop software skills useful for software engineering jobs perhaps (like Unit Testing), and work on the various projects I want to work on now that I'm out of school (like finishing CodeBrix and various other EE and embedded type projects which hopefully will help me get the job(s) of my dreams).
